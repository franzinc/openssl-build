# OpenSSL build script for Windows

## Pre-requisites

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used for the build.
* Cygwin `make`, `bash` and various other tools
* `NASM` is needed for the build.  The included installer (version
  2.11.05) was downloaded from https://www.nasm.us/ and this snapshot
  is here for convenience.  We recommend you get the latest version
  from them.

## Building

Download the `tar.gz` from openssl.org and place it into the cloned
repository, then do:

    $ ./build.sh -32 1.1.1d
    $ ./build.sh -64 1.1.1d

If your VS 2015 environment is set up correctly, the above will
produce two files `openssl-1.1.1d-32.zip` and `openssl-1.1.1d-64.zip`.

The files in this repo are in the public domain, except for the `NASM`
executable, which has a separate license.
